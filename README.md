This repository contains code that is used for various data analysis/data science projects. In most cases, the code is related to a Medium post.

- [online_retail](https://github.com/dpanagop/data_analytics_examples/tree/master/online_retail) has code related to 
an example of segmentation of wholesale customers. It is split into two parts. The [first part](https://towardsdatascience.com/customer-segmentation-part-i-2c5e2145e719) uses natural language processing 
to cluster clients based on their transactions. The [second part](https://towardsdatascience.com/customer-segmentation-part-ii-1c94bdc03de5) creates an RFM segmentation which is combined with the results of the first part.

- [Coronavirus.pbix](https://github.com/dpanagop/data_analytics_examples/blob/master/Coronavirus.pbix) is a Power BI dashboard that about COVID-19. You can read more in the related

- [Markov_text_generation.ipynb](https://github.com/dpanagop/data_analytics_examples/blob/master/Markov_text_generation.ipynb) is a jupyter notebook that uses Markov chains to produce text. You can read more in 
the related [Medium article](https://towardsdatascience.com/using-a-transition-matrix-to-generate-text-in-python-c5e78495b09b?source=your_stories_page-------------------------------------).
- [UMAP](https://github.com/dpanagop/data_analytics_examples/blob/master/UMAP.ipynb) is an example of Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) (for details see [UMAP](https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) algorithm)
